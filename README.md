# HabitMinder

HabitMinder is a habit tracker app geared specifically for the needs of neurodivergent folks.

There have been a lot of great habit trackers around - some beautiful and some not, and everything in between. But I couldn't find one that was geared specifically for the needs of neurodivergent folks, and there aren't many options of any app that are specifically for the needs of such people in the first place. So here I am. What a wonderful way to streamline your life!

Our app is dedicated to helping you build and maintain positive habits while accommodating your specific preferences and requirements. Whether you have ADHD, autism, or other neurodiverse traits, HabitMinder is here to provide you with a user-friendly and supportive experience.
