# HabitMinder

HabitMinder is a habit tracker app geared specifically for the needs of neurodivergent folks.

There have been a lot of great habit trackers around - some beautiful and some not, and everything in between. But I couldn't find one that was geared specifically for the needs of neurodivergent folks, and there aren't many options of any app that are specifically for the needs of such people in the first place. So here I am. What a wonderful way to streamline your life!

Features:
- Add new habits - never worry about remembering them again!
- Filter the habits - easily search them with a single word
- Add tags to your habits - categorize them as "Social", "Work", etc.
- Edit your habits - add neat descriptions to them 
- Mark them as completed, so you won't have to worry about them again (for quite a while)
- Delete them if you have to (make room for new habits)

I hope you enjoy this one!
